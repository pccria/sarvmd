## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Multi-Page Canvas Arrangement Modes (Single, Facing Spread, Continuous Flow, Grid)**:
  - Created top-level `ScoreArrangementCanvas` supporting 5 distinct Gouldian and workflow-optimized layout arrangement modes:
    - `single`: Focused, single-page presentation centered on the canvas.
    - `facingSpread`: Authentic two-page book spread honoring Gouldian engraving conventions (Spread 0: Page 1 on recto with subtle verso placeholder; Spread $S$: Page $2S$ verso | Page $2S+1$ recto separated by an 18 mm book spine gutter).
    - `continuousVertical`: Continuous vertical ribbon stacking all manuscript sheets top-to-bottom with 32 px drop-shadow spacing.
    - `continuousHorizontal`: Continuous horizontal ribbon arranging all pages side-by-side with 32 px spacing.
    - `grid`: Matrix contact sheet overview grouping pages into customizable column chunks (`gridColumns`, 1 to 6).
  - **Interactive Page Activation & Badges**: Integrated active page border highlights and floating page badges (`p. 1`, `p. 2`…) in multi-page modes with seamless tap-to-activate page switching (`onPageTapped`).
  - **Floating Canvas Pill Quick Switcher**: Integrated arrangement mode selector popup directly into the glassmorphic `CanvasPageNavigator` pill on the scoring canvas.
  - **Desktop ViewPanel & Mobile Page Setup Integration**:
    - Added dedicated `Page Arrangement` section with sliding animated segmented buttons and grid column stepper in `ViewPanel`.
    - Added responsive arrangement chip selector directly within `DocumentSettingsGroup` (Page Setup) in `SettingsPanel` (touch drawer) and pointer sidebar.
  - **Auto-Focus Active Page on Navigation**:
    - Implemented mathematical camera centering in `CanvasZoomCalculator.computePageCenter` and `computePageFocusMatrix`, calculating canvas-space bounding centers across all 5 arrangement modes while preserving user zoom level.
    - Added buttery smooth 250 ms `CurvedAnimation(curve: Curves.easeOutCubic)` camera panning in `PointerEditorScreen` and `TouchCanvasArea` triggered whenever the active page changes (via `CanvasPageNavigator`, keyboard shortcuts `PageDown`/`PageUp`, or tapping page badges).
    - Added configurable `autoFocusOnPageChange` toggle in `ViewState`/`ViewCubit` with SharedPreferences persistence, surfaced in both `ViewPanel` and `DocumentSettingsGroup`.
    - Added bilingual English (`Auto-Focus Active Page`) and Persian (`تمرکز خودکار روی صفحه فعال`) localization strings.
  - **State & SharedPreferences Persistence**: Extended `ViewState` and `ViewCubit` with `pageArrangement` and `gridColumns` properties with instant local persistence.
  - **Bilingual Localization**: Added full English (`app_en.arb`) and Persian (`app_fa.arb`) localization keys for all 5 modes, section descriptions, and grid column counters.
- **Multi-Page Canvas Navigation & Interactive Pagination**:
  - Implemented floating, glassmorphic `CanvasPageNavigator` widget providing seamless page stepping (`< Page X of Y >`), direct sheet increment (`+`), and sheet removal (`-`) directly on the scoring canvas.
  - Enabled multi-page layout rendering across `PreviewCanvas`, automatically computing Gouldian title blocks and first-system indentation on Page 1 while restoring full staff headroom (0 mm) and running headers (`- 2 -`, `- 3 -`) on Page 2+.
  - Integrated document page count management directly into `DocumentSettingsGroup` (Page Setup) featuring an interactive stepper and quick preset chips (`1`, `2`, `4`, `8`), wired to `DocumentCubit.setPageCount`.
  - Added global multi-page keyboard navigation intents (`NextPageIntent`, `PreviousPageIntent`) bound to `PageDown` / `Alt+ArrowRight` and `PageUp` / `Alt+ArrowLeft` in `ShortcutGateway`, and documented them in `KeyboardShortcutsDialog`.
  - Synced multi-page settings with `ExportDialog` so export flows default to the active document page count.
- **Printable Score Typography Canvas & Export Integration**:
  - Implemented `_paintScoreTypography` in `PreviewCanvas` rendering title, subtitle, composer, arranger, lyricist, bottom copyright, and running page numbers in real time.
  - Wired `DocumentCubit.layout` with document metadata and updated `PointerEditorScreen` and `TouchCanvasArea` canvas bindings.
  - Connected `ExportService` (`exportTex`, `exportPdf`, `exportSvg`) to pass active score metadata to compiler emitters.
- **Score Information & Typography Configuration Section & Rationalized UX**:
  - Added dedicated `ScoreTypographySettingsGroup` widget positioned directly below Page Setup in both the Pointer Editor left sidebar (`CollapsibleSectionCard`) and Touch Drawer (`SettingsPanel`).
  - **Progressive Disclosure Architecture**: Prominently features primary work credits (Title, Composer) while nesting situational secondary credits (Subtitle, Arranger, Lyricist) within a smooth animated progressive disclosure accordion that automatically expands whenever secondary credits contain text.
  - **Animated Master Switch Collapse**: Toggling off the master Header Block smoothly collapses first-page inputs using `AnimatedSize` rather than occupying dead vertical sidebar space, displaying an informative notice.
  - **Live Gouldian Headroom Badge**: Integrated dynamic headroom badge showing calculated millimetric clearance reserved on page 1 for title typography (`ScoreTypographyMetrics.computeHeaderHeadroomMm`).
  - **Reactive Eye Toggles**: Eye visibility buttons dynamically reflect input state (ghosted/muted when empty with "Enter text to display" tooltip, active primary when visible, and strike-through when hidden on score).
  - Added master Header Block and Page Numbers switches, and "Advanced Properties…" shortcut button.
  - Added `SettingsSection.scoreTypography` to `ViewState` and wired SectionSpine 8-bead navigation.
  - Enhanced `DocumentPropertiesDialog` with inline show/hide switches for all metadata fields.
  - Added complete English (`app_en.arb`) and Persian (`app_fa.arb`) localization strings.
- **UI Application Manual & Development Guide (`apps/sarvmd_ui/README.md`)**:
  - Published comprehensive user and contributor manual covering the three-tier Cubit state architecture (`WorkspaceCubit`, `DocumentCubit`, `ViewCubit`), responsive form factors (desktop, tablet, phone), live vector canvas, CAD crosshairs, millimeter HUD bubbles, and complete keyboard shortcuts reference table.
  - Added build and runtime guides for Linux Desktop, Web (CanvasKit/WASM), Windows, and Android.
- **Monorepo Architecture & Synchronized Versioning**:
  - Decoupled changelog tracking across monorepo packages into dedicated domain changelogs (`packages/sarvmd_core/CHANGELOG.md`, `apps/sarvmd_cli/CHANGELOG.md`, `apps/sarvmd_ui/CHANGELOG.md`).
  - Standardized package manifest versions (`0.12.4`) across `sarvmd_core`, `sarvmd_cli`, and `sarvmd_ui`.
  - Added centralized documentation navigation hubs in root [`README.md`](file:///home/ono/Projects/sarvmd/README.md) and [`README.fa.md`](file:///home/ono/Projects/sarvmd/README.fa.md).

## [0.12.4] - 2026-10-22

### Added
- **Hierarchical Back Navigation & Exit Ergonomics (`TouchEditorScreen` & `SettingsPanel`) (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - **Model A Hierarchical Sub-Page Unwinding**: Integrated nested back interception in `TouchEditorScreen` and `SettingsPanel` ensuring that pressing Back from any settings sub-page (*Margins*, *Staff Spacing*, *Page Setup*, *Profiles*, *Hierarchy*, *Export*) cleanly navigates back to the Main Menu rather than abruptly popping and destroying the drawer.
  - **Peek Restoration on Back**: Pressing Back while the settings panel is in Peek mode seamlessly restores the panel to full view.
  - **Double-Back to Exit Guard**: Implemented double-back to exit protection on the root canvas for clean documents, displaying a localized floating SnackBar (*"Press back again to exit"* / *"برای خروج دوباره بازگشت را بزنید"*) with a 2-second timeout to prevent accidental exits caused by canvas edge-panning gestures.
  - **Unsaved Changes Guard on Root Back**: Intercepts Back on dirty documents and prompts the user via `showUnsavedChangesDialog` (*Save*, *Discard*, *Cancel*), preventing accidental data loss.
  - **Transient Overlay Dismissal**: Prioritizes unfocusing active title edits, dismissing the glassmorphic coordinate HUD, and collapsing the expanded Zen top bar before triggering root navigation.
  - **Canvas Camera Preservation**: Preserves canvas zoom scale and pan coordinates throughout all Back actions.

### Fixed & Improved
- **Portrait Pointer Mode Top Bar Overflow (`PointerTopBar` & `EditableScoreHeader`) (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Resolved `RenderFlex overflowed by X pixels on the right` in the top bar on narrow mobile viewports (< 480dp) in Pointer Mode while preserving direct 1-tap Undo and Redo access.
  - Replaced nested single-child `Row` inside `EditableScoreHeader` with `Align`, tightened compact bar padding on narrow viewports, and dynamically hid decorative trailing edit icons (`< 100dp`) and dirty status dots (`< 50dp`) so that the title ellipsizes cleanly within available space without overflowing the flex layout.
- **Peek Barrier Interaction Resilience (`TouchEditorScreen`) (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Configured `drawerBarrierDismissible: !isPanelPeeking` on the root `Scaffold`, preventing the modal barrier from prematurely intercepting taps or back gestures and dismissing the drawer while in peek mode.

## [0.12.3] - 2026-10-15

### Added
- **Touch Section Spine (`_TouchSectionSpine`) (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Implemented a 42dp vertical navigation spine on the leading edge of `SettingsPanel` in Touch Mode with 7 interactive beads (`mainMenu`, `profiles`, `pageSetup`, `margins`, `staffSpacing`, `systemHierarchy`, `export`).
  - Enables instant 1-tap switching between any panel section without forcing users through the hierarchical `Back -> Menu -> Category` drill-down loop.
  - Wrapped with `SingleChildScrollView` and bouncing physics for zero-overflow resilience on compact landscape screens (tested down to 340dp height).
- **Geometric Canvas Occlusion Detection (`CanvasZoomCalculator.isTargetOccluded`) (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Added smart geometric occlusion detection that checks whether the settings panel physically overlaps the bounding box of the rendered manuscript paper or active margin guidelines.
  - Keeps the panel 100% solid and legible when the score sits in clear aperture, and only triggers see-through ghosting (0.18 opacity) when occluding the active target during scrubbing.

### Fixed & Improved
- **Canvas Viewport State Preservation Across Panel Toggles (`PointerEditorScreen`)**:
  - Decoupled `InteractiveViewer` pan and zoom matrices from panel collapse and expansion events. Opening, closing, or docking sidebars now strictly preserves user camera position and zoom factor instead of resetting viewport matrix.
- **Eliminated Duplicate Badges & Glance Controls (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Removed duplicate floating telemetry badge in pointer mode when the left sidebar header already displays live values.
  - Removed redundant secondary peek button from touch sub-page section headers.
- **Touch Header Controls Ergonomics & Squircles (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Moved `GlanceButton` (peek button) to the rightmost edge in the header row.
  - Unified `TouchLanguageButton`, `TouchThemeButton`, and `GlanceButton` into comfortable 44×40dp squircles (`BorderRadius.circular(14.0)`) with 144dp total row width, preventing pixel overflow while providing generous finger touch targets.
  - Updated `TouchThemeButton` to display current accent color choice via dynamic border (`1.8dp`), glow shadow, and mode icon, eliminating the extra horizontal color dot.
  - Updated `TouchLanguageButton` to stack prominent bold locale typography (`FA` / `EN`) over a translucent 24dp globe watermark for immediate legibility.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed
- **Scaled Staff Line Gap & Connector Alignment (`sarvmd_core` & `sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - **Effective Line Gap for Scaled Staves**: Fixed staff line rendering across all 4 emitters (`PreviewCanvas`, `SvgEmitter`, `PdfEmitter`, and LaTeX `Emitter`) to compute line positions using `lineGap * staff.scale`. Previously, the staff lines were drawn with the unscaled global `lineGap` (e.g. 1.8mm = 7.2mm staff height), while clef sizing/anchoring, initial barlines, brackets, braces, and system spacing were already scaled by `staff.scale` (0.70 × 7.2mm = 5.04mm). This created a severe mathematical mismatch where treble clefs anchored for line 2 appeared on line 3, brackets ended short on the bottom staff, and staff lines protruded past barlines into inter-staff gaps.
  - **Clef Clearance Sizing**: Scaled horizontal clef clearance (`glyphX` / `cx`) by `staff.scale` in PDF and SVG emitters, maintaining proportional visual breathing room across different rastral staff sizes.
- **Left Panel Slider & Numeric Input Reactivity (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - **Eliminated RenderFlex Layout Overflow in Staff Size Chip**: Fixed a fatal layout exception in `_LiveStatsChip` (`staff_spacing_group.dart`) where an unconstrained stats column widened upon spacing changes, starving the dropdown button below its 42px minimum width and throwing `A RenderFlex overflowed by 7.0 pixels on the right`. This layout exception previously broke Flutter's dirty subtree render scheduling during gestures, causing sliders and inputs in the left sidebar to freeze visually while the canvas updated.
  - **Proportional Flex & Auto-Scaling Readout**: Rebalanced `_LiveStatsChip` with `Expanded(flex: 5)` for the preset dropdown and `Expanded(flex: 4)` with `FittedBox` scale-down for the stats readout, guaranteeing zero overflow even on narrow viewports or long localized text.
  - **Scrubbing Desync & Stale Submission Guard**: Synchronized `_controller.text` during pointer movements in `_ScrubbableField` (`margins_settings_group.dart`) and guarded `onTapOutside` submissions with `if (!_isDragging)` in both `_ScrubbableField` and `_AnnotatedSlider`, preventing focus-loss events from reverting in-progress scrub values.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-10-02

### Changed
- **Profile Layout & Spacing Tidying (`sarvmd_core`)**:
  - **Eliminated Wasted Indentation from Violin Numbering**: Removed redundant inner Roman numbering (`GroupNumberingStyle.none`) and hid sub-group headers (`labelVisible: false`) on Violins in both `String Orchestra` and `Chamber Orchestra` profiles. In classical house style, the sub-bracket now sits flush at the barline, and violin staves (`Violin I`, `Violin II`) align in a clean, unified column alongside Viola, Violoncello, and Double Bass without inflating system indentation.
  - **Chamber Orchestra Vertical Proportions & Modern Header**: Scaled Chamber Orchestra staves to `scale: 0.70` (rastral size 7, ~5.0mm height per Gould guidelines), enabling 2 full systems to fit comfortably on standard A4 portrait pages instead of wasting vertical space with only a single system. Defaulted all sections (Woodwinds, Brass, Strings) to Modern Header (`GroupLabelPlacement.aboveStaff`), placing section labels cleanly above staves with zero redundant margin indentation.

### Fixed
- **Chamber Orchestra Mini Staff Preview (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Resolved missing mini preview card for `Chamber Orchestra` (and multi-group ensembles) by querying `rootGroup.allStaves` rather than direct `StaffDefinition` children.
  - Added adaptive condensed multi-staff rendering for 3+ staves with scaled line gaps and authentic SMuFL brackets.
- **Profile Switching & Disposed Cubit Resilience (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Fixed `Bad state: Cannot emit new states after calling close` when switching profiles after workspace tab initialization or tab switching. [PointerEditorScreen](file:///home/ono/Projects/sarvmd/apps/sarvmd_ui/lib/src/presentation/screens/pointer_editor_screen.dart) now watches `DocumentCubit` to rebind upon session changes, and [ProfilePicker](file:///home/ono/Projects/sarvmd/apps/sarvmd_ui/lib/src/presentation/widgets/staff/profile_picker.dart) evaluates the active cubit directly from the current build context.
  - Added defensive `isClosed` lifecycle guards to `DocumentCubit._syncState()`, `execute()`, `undo()`, `redo()`, and `markSaved()`.
- **System Count Grammatical Pluralization (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Upgraded `systemsCount` in `app_en.arb` to use ICU plural format (`{count, plural, =1{1 System} other{{count} Systems}}`), ensuring the bottom status bar and summary badges correctly display "1 System" instead of "1 Systems".

## [0.12.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added
- **Group Engraving Modal & Dual-Tier Progressive Disclosure (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Implemented **Paradigm A: Dual-Tier Progressive Disclosure**: simplified the inline `QuickLabelingCard` for fast renaming (~80px height) while delegating deep score-level engraving controls (Model C placement, Header Lifecycle across systems, Continental vs. Anglo-American descriptor placement, Model B child staff numbering) to a dedicated 560px modal dialog (`GroupEngravingDialog`) opened via `showSarvAdaptiveModal`.
  - Added direct action button and popup menu item to `StaffGroupWidget` to open the engraving modal.
  - Added double-tap to rename directly on staff instrument labels in `StaffItemWidget`.
- **GroupHeaderVisibility Lifecycle Control (`sarvmd_core` & `sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Added `GroupHeaderVisibility` enum (`firstSystemOnly`, `firstSystemOfPage`, `always`) to `StaffNodeGroup` and `GroupPlacement`, controlling section header lifecycle across systems and pages for Model C above-staff labels.
  - Decoupled score-start from page-start via optional `pageIndex` in `computeLayout`, accommodating classical European publishing traditions (Bärenreiter/Breitkopf section headers re-printed at the top of each page) while defaulting to Gould/MOLA first-system suppression.
  - Unified cross-engine parity across all 4 emitters (`preview_canvas.dart`, `svg_emitter.dart`, `pdf_emitter.dart`, and `emitter.dart`) by consuming precomputed `group.isAboveStaffVisible`.
  - Added responsive `SegmentedButton` controls in `QuickLabelingCard` with dynamic description tooltips.
- **Engraving Label UI Maturation & Feedback (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - **Missing Abbreviation Amber Indicator**: Added an amber dot indicator in `StaffItemWidget` for staves with visible labels but missing abbreviations, alerting the engraver that subsequent systems will fall back to full instrument names.
  - **Resolved Label Preview Chip**: Added a dynamic preview chip badge (`[Label: $resolved]`) in `StaffItemWidget` displaying the actual hierarchical engraving label when it differs from the user-entered display name (e.g., when Model B auto-numbering assigns *1, 2* or *I, II*).
  - **Quick Typography Styling Bar**: Embedded an inline styling bar directly in `QuickLabelingCard` for staves, supporting instant bold/italic toggles, Serif/Sans switching, and font size adjustments without leaving the panel.
  - **Staff Bold Typography Support**: Added `labelBold` support to `LiveStaffPreview`, `FineTuningTab`, and `StaffConfigDialog` with full English and Persian localization (`boldLabelHeader`, `boldLabelDesc`).
- **DescriptorPlacement (Continental vs. Anglo-American Placement Styles) (`sarvmd_core` & `sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Added `DescriptorPlacement` enum (`enclosedByConnector`, `outsideConnector`) allowing users to choose between Anglo-American style (inner descriptors enclosed between bracket and staves) and Continental style (bracket flush against initial barline with descriptors placed outside).
  - Implemented the Universal Classical Brace Rule in `layout.dart`: braces (`{`) are universally placed flush at the starting barline (`DescriptorPlacement.outsideConnector`), preserving historical engraving invariants.
  - Eliminated architectural gaps L3 and E2: promoted `innerStaffIndices` to a precalculated `Set<int>` property on `StaffSystem`, unifying layout calculation with all 4 emitters (`preview_canvas.dart`, `svg_emitter.dart`, `pdf_emitter.dart`, and `emitter.dart`).
  - Added responsive UI controls in `QuickLabelingCard` with `SegmentedButton` and descriptive guide cards.
  - Added 35th visual test scenario (`hierarchical_continental_outside`) to the QA Visual Gallery.
- **StaffLabelStyle Value Object Extraction (`sarvmd_core` & `sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Extracted centralized `StaffLabelStyle` value object (`fontFamily`, `fontSizePt`, `isItalic`, `isBold`, `horizontalOffsetMm`, `verticalOffsetMm`) with presets `defaultStaff` and `boldUpright`.
  - Refactored `StaffDefinition` to use `labelStyle` with seamless backward-and-forward JSON serialization compatibility (reading new `'labelStyle'` maps while losslessly migrating legacy 5-field files, and serializing both).
  - Propagated resolved style to layout through `StaffPosition.resolvedLabelStyle`.
  - Upgraded all 4 rendering backends (`preview_canvas.dart`, `svg_emitter.dart`, `pdf_emitter.dart`, and `emitter.dart`) to consume `StaffLabelStyle`, adding bold/italic font styling and micrometer offset parity.
- **Advanced Sub-Group Labeling Modes: Model B & Model C (`sarvmd_core` & `sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - **Model B (Centered Group Label + Inner Arabic/Roman Numerals)**: Added `StaffNodeGroup.numberingStyle` (`GroupNumberingStyle.none`, `.arabic`, `.roman`) with intelligent numeral formatting (`formatGroupStaffNumber`, `toRomanNumeral`). Dynamically replaces generic child staff names (e.g. *Horn 1*, *Flute*, *1*) with compact Arabic (*1, 2*) or Roman (*I, II*) numerals while safely preserving auxiliary instruments (e.g. *Piccolo*, *English Horn*, *Bass Clarinet*). Scopes inner staff descriptor clearance to ~2.6mm, pulling sub-brackets flush to staves.
  - **Model C (Section Headers Above Staves)**: Added `StaffNodeGroup.labelPlacement` (`GroupLabelPlacement.margin`, `.aboveStaff`). Automatically renders section titles (e.g. *WOODWINDS*, *BRASS*) above the topmost staff of the group at `topY - 2.5mm`, completely bypassing horizontal margin space (`groupLabelWidthMm = 0.0`, `labelOffsetMm = 0.0`) and eliminating 25mm–35mm of wasted left margin per system.
  - **Cross-Engine Visual Parity Across All 4 Renderers**: Unified layout and rendering across Interactive Canvas (`preview_canvas.dart`), Direct Vector PDF (`pdf_emitter.dart`), Vector SVG (`svg_emitter.dart`), and LaTeX (`emitter.dart`).
  - **Robust PDF Music Symbol Sanitization**: Built accidental symbol transliteration (`♭` -> `b`, `♯` -> `#`, `♮` -> ` `) and Latin-1 character filtering into `pdf_emitter.dart` and LaTeX escaping into `emitter.dart`, preventing runtime codec failures when exporting scores with accidental-qualified instrument labels (e.g. *Clarinets in B♭*).
  - **UI Integration in AdvancedBuilderPanel**: Added responsive `SegmentedButton` controls in `_QuickLabelingCard` for **Group Label Placement** (*Margin* vs *Above Staff*) and **Child Staff Numbering** (*None*, *Arabic 1, 2*, *Roman I, II*) with localized helper tooltips and transactional command dispatching via `DocumentCubit.updateGroupDetails`.
  - **34-Scenario QA Visual Validation Gallery Expansion**: Added Model B and Model C visual test scenarios to `tool/generate_qa_gallery.dart`.
- **Master Engraving Bracket Cluster Architecture (`layout.dart`)**:
  - Replaced horizontal multi-column bracket staggering ("Russian-doll tiering") with classical master engraving cluster architecture (Bärenreiter, Breitkopf, Gould): outer brackets cluster tightly adjacent to inner brackets with standard 3.0mm spacing (`connectorLevelSpacingMm`).
  - Hierarchical outer-column group label positioning: group labels and section titles sit outside all covering connectors in a unified, aligned outer column, eliminating over 41mm of wasted horizontal margin space on nested woodwind/brass scores.
  - Hierarchical label offset delegation (`GroupPlacement.labelOffsetMm`): accurately tracks child group label widths to position parent family labels (e.g. *Woodwinds*, *Strings*) strictly outside nested sub-group labels without bracket displacement.
- **LaTeX Vector Emitter Hierarchical Labeling & Connectors (`emitter.dart`)**:
  - Full structural parity with Flutter Canvas, PDF, and SVG emitters: traverses all `SystemGroupPlacement` nodes in `system.groupPlacements` instead of only the root group.
  - Generates authentic bracket backbones, sub-brackets (without serif ticks), piano braces, and initial barlines with precise SMuFL offsets.
  - Integrated standard LaTeX zero-dependency `picture` text environment (`\put(x, -y){\makebox(0,0)[r]{...}}`) placing right-aligned group labels and staff instrument names/abbreviations with exact micrometer coordinates, Helvetica typography, and multi-line (`\shortstack[r]`) support.
- **Engraving Standards Research & 32-Scenario QA Visual Validation Gallery**:
  - Conducted comparative music engraving research (`standard_score_examples_and_subgroup_labeling.md`) benchmarking master publisher editions (Bärenreiter Urtext, Breitkopf & Härtel, Boosey & Hawkes, Durand, Gould) for sub-group space conservation (Model A flat inline, Model B centered names with inner numbers, and Model C section headers above staves).
  - Built an automated 32-scenario QA visual validation test generator (`tool/generate_qa_gallery.dart`) outputting side-by-side SVG, PDF, TeX, and an interactive HTML comparison gallery (`export_gallery.html`) covering all 14 presets, paper sizes (A3, A4, A5, Letter), orientations, layering modes, and complex hierarchical groupings.

### Changed
- **System Hierarchy Panel Modularization & Architecture Modernization (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Decomposed the monolithic ~3,770-line `advanced_builder_panel.dart` into a modular, clean hierarchy component architecture under `apps/sarvmd_ui/lib/src/presentation/widgets/panels/hierarchy/`:
    - `system_hierarchy_panel.dart`: Top-level orchestrator and contextual action bar (CAB).
    - `staff_group_widget.dart`: Recursive group node container, drop targets, and drag-and-drop orchestration.
    - `staff_item_widget.dart`: Staff row presentation, quick clef picker, selection controls, and drag handle.
    - `quick_labeling_card.dart`: Inline label editing container (`typedef InlineLabelEditor = QuickLabelingCard`).
    - `labeling/label_typography_cluster.dart`: Isolated typography controls with responsive layout.
    - `labeling/group_numbering_section.dart`: Gould non-redundancy, Model B, and Model C auto-numbering configuration.
    - `connector_picker_widgets.dart`: Connector picker menu and segmented selector.
    - `hierarchy_tree_utils.dart` & `hierarchy_types.dart`: Pure tree algorithms and immutable drag payload records.
    - `hierarchy_feedback.dart`: Drag ghost badges and selection chips.
  - Aligned panel naming to match `SettingsSection.systemHierarchy` (`SystemHierarchyPanel` in `panels/system_hierarchy_panel.dart`), removing the legacy `advanced_builder_panel.dart` file.
- **Gouldian Space-Efficient Hierarchical Labeling Architecture (`sarvmd_core` & `sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - **Local Inner Descriptor Scoping**: Scoped inner staff descriptor widths strictly to their immediate group branch, eliminating system-wide margin bloat where long instrument names (e.g. *Double Bass*) previously displaced unrelated sub-brackets (e.g. *Flutes 1 & 2*) by dozens of millimeters.
  - **Single-Tier vs Two-Tier Differentiation**: Single-tier groups without group labels (e.g. Piano grand staff, String Quartet) place connectors flush against the initial barline (`connectorOffsetMm = 0.0`) with staff names positioned outside, saving 6–10mm of margin width. Two-tier groups with outer labels properly enclose inner descriptors between the connector and staves.
  - **Subsequent System Compaction (Gould p. 515)**: Automatically omits family group labels (e.g. *Strings*, *Woodwinds*) on system 2+ when no explicit abbreviation is specified, reclaiming 20mm–48mm of printable notation width across subsequent systems and pages.
  - **Row-Aware Vertical Disjointness**: Replaced additive connector level offset accumulation across vertically separated instrument families with row-aware maximum indent calculations.
  - **Calibrated Gould/SMuFL Clearances (`GroupPlacementMetrics`)**: Tightened connector level spacing to 3.0mm, bracket tick length to 1.8mm, staff label clearance to 2.0mm, and connector inner clearance to 1.5mm.
  - **Unified Cross-Emitter Parity**: Identical geometry and alignment verified across Flutter Canvas (`preview_canvas.dart`), Vector PDF (`pdf_emitter.dart`), Vector SVG (`svg_emitter.dart`), and LaTeX (`emitter.dart`).

### Fixed
- **Desktop & Web Keyboard Shortcuts Reliability (`SarvShortcutGateway`)**:
  - Converted `SarvShortcutGateway` to a `StatefulWidget` establishing a dedicated `FocusScopeNode` (`SarvShortcutGatewayScope`) directly under its `Shortcuts` and `Actions`.
  - Resolved focus trapping where calling `unfocus()` in sliders or text fields relinquished control to `Scaffold`'s ancestor `FocusScopeNode`, stranding focus outside the shortcut tree and causing shortcuts to silently fail.
  - Wrapped `Scaffold` inside `SarvShortcutGateway` in both `PointerEditorScreen` and `EmptyWorkspaceView`.
  - Added translucent pointer-down listener to the manuscript preview canvas in `PointerEditorScreen` to restore shortcut gateway focus whenever the user clicks, drags, or zooms the canvas.
  - Added `onClose` focus restoration hooks to desktop top bar menus (`TopBarMenuHeader` and `TopBarCompactAppMenu`).
  - Added comprehensive test suite `shortcut_gateway_test.dart` verifying launch autofocus, post-unfocus shortcut retention, manual recovery, menu dismissal, and canvas tap-to-focus.
- **Standardized RenderFlex Overflow Handling in Narrow Hierarchy Panels (`sarvmd_ui`)**:
  - Implemented the 6-point layout framework across hierarchy components to eliminate `RenderFlex` overflows when sidebars are resized down to 200–280px:
    - Bounded `LayoutBuilder` width inspection for `StaffItemWidget`, dynamically collapsing secondary buttons into a compact `PopupMenuButton` when row width is constrained (< 280px), preserving instrument name visibility and preventing horizontal overflows.
    - Adaptive segmented button labels in `GroupNumberingSection` based on width breakpoints (`isNarrow < 270px`).
    - Flow-based `Wrap` layout with dynamic wrapping for metadata badges, clef chips, and font adjustment handles (`LabelTypographyCluster`).
    - `Expanded` containers paired with `TextOverflow.ellipsis` on all flexible text elements.
- **Group Label Editing In-Place Replacement (`StaffGroupWidget`)**:
  - Fixed non-standard UI behavior where group header cards persisted alongside the label editor during editing mode; group headers are now replaced in-place by `QuickLabelingCard` / `InlineLabelEditor` until dismissed or saved.
- **Above-Staff Section Header Vertical Headroom Reservation (`layout.dart`)**:
  - Fixed an active visual collision bug on multi-system pages where section headers placed above staves (`GroupLabelPlacement.aboveStaff`) collided with the bottom staff of the preceding system.
  - Automatically reserves `GroupPlacementMetrics.aboveStaffHeaderClearanceMm` (5.5mm) in inter-system gap distribution when above-staff headers are present, preventing systems from overflowing into bottom page margins.
- **Above-Staff Section Header Subsequent System Suppression (`layout.dart` & all 4 emitters)**:
  - Fixed a defect where section headers placed above staves (Model C) re-rendered on system 2+ using their abbreviation or label.
  - Aligned with Gould (*Behind Bars*, p. 515) and MOLA engraving guidelines by strictly suppressing above-staff headers on subsequent systems across the layout engine and all 4 rendering backends (`preview_canvas.dart`, `svg_emitter.dart`, `pdf_emitter.dart`, and `emitter.dart`).
- **Engraving Metrics Standardization (`GroupPlacementMetrics`)**:
  - Extracted centralized engraving constants `aboveStaffHeaderClearanceMm = 5.5` and `aboveStaffHeaderOffsetMm = 2.5` into `GroupPlacementMetrics` in `config.dart`, replacing ad-hoc magic numbers across all vector emitters.
  - Added recursive `allGroups` hierarchy traversal getter to `StaffNodeGroup`.
- **Sidebar Collapsible Sections & Scrollbar State Synchronization (`ViewCubit` & `SectionSpine`)**:
  - Fixed an issue where collapsing all sidebar sections in pointer mode caused them to randomly expand during scrolling or when selecting sections from the custom scrollbar.
  - Decoupled viewport scroll detection (`ViewCubit.setActiveSection`) from section expansion mutations: scrolling now only tracks the active touch section for custom scrollbar handle alignment without expanding collapsed cards or overriding `jumpTargetSection`.
  - Configured custom scrollbar bead selection (`ViewCubit.jumpToSection`) to explicitly expand the clicked section if collapsed, persist expansion state to `SharedPreferences`, and smoothly scroll into position while preserving the collapsed state of all other sections.
  - Added dedicated unit tests in `view_cubit_panel_state_test.dart` verifying that scrolling preserves collapsed states and bead clicks expand only the targeted section.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- **Recent Documents History & Menu Integration (`RecentDocumentsService`)**:
  - Persistent recent documents history backed by `SharedPreferences` (`sarvmd_recent_documents`) capped at 10 items with deduplication, top promotion, and automatic pruning of non-existent files on native platforms.
  - Cascading `Open Recent ▸` submenu in desktop wide mode, compact application menu, and touch file menus with path tooltips, ellipsis truncation, and "Clear Recent Files" action.
  - Smart tab handling: opening a recent document that is already open focuses its existing tab rather than opening a duplicate session.
- **Score Metadata / Document Properties Dialog (`DocumentPropertiesDialog`)**:
  - Adaptive modal dialog (`showDocumentPropertiesDialog`) and bottom sheet on mobile for viewing and editing extended `.sarv` score metadata fields (`title`, `subtitle`, `composer`, `arranger`, `lyricist`, `copyright`).
  - Read-only document properties card showing exact file location on disk, creation timestamp, and last modified timestamp.
  - Transactional undo/redo integration with `DocumentCubit` via `core.SetMetadataCommand`, synchronized with `core.Score.title`.

- **Web `beforeunload` Unsaved Changes Protection**:
  - Registered browser-native `beforeunload` event handler via Dart JS-interop in `web_download_web.dart` triggered dynamically whenever any open tab has unsaved changes (`hasDirtyTabs`) to protect against accidental browser tab close or refresh data loss.
- **Cross-Platform Pre-Extension File Disambiguation Engine (`packages/sarvmd_core`)**:
  - Introduced zero-dependency `FileNaming` utility module (`appendSuffix`, `appendIndex`, `stripExtension`, `getExtension`, `disambiguateFileName`, `ensureUniquePath`).
  - Standardized collision disambiguation across platforms to strictly insert numeric indices immediately before file extensions (e.g. `Score (1).pdf` or `Score_1.pdf`) rather than trailing after the extension.
- **Editable Destination Folder & Path Normalization in Export Dialog (`ExportDialog` & `ExportDirectoryService`)**:
  - Upgraded the Destination Folder field to an interactive monospace text input supporting direct typing, path pasting, focus management, and automatic normalization.
  - Implemented `ExportDirectoryService.normalizeExportPath` with user tilde (`~`) expansion to home directory, stripping of `file://` URI schemes, redundant and trailing slash cleanup, and Windows drive letter path support, resolving file picker ambiguity on Linux desktop environments.
- **Comprehensive Persistence & Workspace Test Suites**:
  - Added end-to-end unit and widget test suites covering document serialization, file service operations, persistence cubit workflows, dirty state tracking, pointer tab bar interactions, touch tab switcher modal flows, recent documents service and UI integration, export directory path normalization, native Android SAF save contract, and document properties dialog workflows (`document_persistence_test.dart`, `sarv_file_service_test.dart`, `file_ui_components_test.dart`, `workspace_cubit_test.dart`, `pointer_tab_bar_test.dart`, `touch_tab_switcher_test.dart`, `recent_documents_test.dart`, `export_directory_service_test.dart`, `native_file_save_service_test.dart`, `document_properties_dialog_test.dart`).

### Changed
- **Document Model Decoupling**:
  - Decoupled `DocumentCubit` and `DocumentState` to carry file path and dirty state directly alongside `PageConfig`.
  - Streamlined `ScoreCommand` architecture to support non-mutating clean marks on document saving.

### Removed
- **Obsolete Notation AST & Experimental Composer**:
  - Purged legacy, incomplete music notation AST types (`clef.dart`, `pitch.dart`, `duration.dart`, `measure.dart`, `musical_event.dart`, `signature.dart`, `engraver.dart`, `spacing_spindle.dart`) and retired the experimental `sarvmd_composer` package.
  - Consolidated codebase strictly around high-performance blank canvas manuscript design and vector engraving.

### Fixed
- **Center-Focal Touch HUD Zoom (`FloatingHud`)**:
  - Fixed issue where touch HUD stepper zoom buttons (`+` and `-`) and scrubbable scale chips (`_CollapsedScrubbableChip`, `_ScrubbableZoomChip`) scaled the canvas from the world-space top-left origin `(0, 0)`.
  - Replaced naive translation retention with center-anchored affine transformation (`_applyScaleAtCenter`) using `MediaQuery.sizeOf(context)` to zoom smoothly into the viewport center.
- **Affine Scale Vector Component Sizing (`PointerEditorScreen`)**:
  - Corrected `scaleByDouble` invocation in `PointerEditorScreen._zoomBy` by supplying 4 positional vector parameters (`targetScale, targetScale, 1.0, 1.0`), resolving static analysis errors.
- **Zero-Document Action Safety (`SarvShortcutGateway`)**:
  - Guarded document shortcut callback handlers (`UndoIntent`, `RedoIntent`, `SaveDocumentIntent`, `SaveAsDocumentIntent`, `ExportIntent`, `DocumentPropertiesIntent`) against null `DocumentCubit` when operating within the zero-document empty workspace state.
- **Distinct File Deduplication for Copies & Identical Content (`WorkspaceCubit` & `AppShell`)**:
  - Fixed issue where distinct files with identical score contents (e.g. `sample.sarv` and `sample (1).sarv` created via "Save As" or copy-paste) were erroneously treated as the same document and deduplicated into a single tab due to indiscriminate score title and content equality matching.
  - Refined file deduplication criteria in `WorkspaceCubit.openDocumentTab` and `AppShell._handleDroppedFiles` to strictly require matching file identities (path or filename) when both documents have explicit file backings, reserving deep content equivalence matching (`hasSameContent`) strictly for untitled in-memory manuscripts.
- **Web Blob URL Sanitization & Document Name Parity (`DocumentState`, `WorkspaceCubit`, & `AppShell`)**:
  - Resolved issue where opening or dropping files on Web displayed random UUID hashes (e.g. `9bf3e8d2-4521-4f1a-b678-0123456789ab`) as the document tab title and default save name instead of the actual file name.
  - Guarded `DocumentState.displayName`, `WorkspaceCubit.openDocumentTab`, `SarvFileService.openSarvFile`, and `RecentDocumentsService.addRecentDocument` against Web `blob:` and `http:` object URLs, strictly normalizing to the genuine file name (`file.name`).
- **Web & Desktop Document Tab Deduplication & Drag-and-Drop Parity (`WorkspaceCubit` & `AppShell`)**:
  - Resolved issue in Web where dragging or opening an already-open `.sarv` document created redundant duplicate tabs rather than switching to the existing open tab.
  - Added robust multi-criteria deduplication in `WorkspaceCubit.openDocumentTab` matching by exact file path, filename/basename, and document content equivalence across desktop and web.
  - Ensured Web dropped files and opened files retain their file identity (`filePath: fileName`) so loaded documents are never mistaken for blank placeholder tabs or duplicated upon subsequent drag-and-drop operations.
  - Added "Switched to tab" visual feedback and icon indicator parity when dragging already-open documents on Web.
- **Android SAF Pre-Extension Duplicate Numbering (`NativeFileSaveService` & `MainActivity.kt`)**:
  - Resolved Android Storage Access Framework (SAF) issue where filename collision numbers were placed after the extension (e.g. `Treble_A4_Portrait.pdf (1)` or `Treble_A4_Portrait.sarv (1)`).
  - Implemented `NativeFileSaveService` bridging to native Android `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT` with explicit MIME types (`application/pdf`, `image/svg+xml`, `text/plain`, `application/octet-stream`).
  - Added native post-creation regex inspection and `DocumentsContract.renameDocument` handling in `MainActivity.kt` to ensure collision indices are strictly positioned immediately before the extension (`Treble_A4_Portrait (1).pdf` and `Treble_A4_Portrait (1).sarv`).
- **Touch Tab Switcher Synchronous Dismissal & Empty Workspace Recovery (`TouchTabSwitcherModal` & `WorkspaceCubit`)**:
  - Fixed Flutter framework crash `A dismissed Dismissible widget is still part of the tree` in `TouchTabSwitcherModal` by synchronously removing dismissed items from local state prior to awaiting asynchronous tab closure operations.
  - Hardened `WorkspaceCubit` when dismissing or closing the final active tab, automatically initializing a fresh default manuscript session (`createDefaultSession`) rather than corrupting state or leaving an empty workspace.
- **Web Build File Saving & Destination Selection (`saveFileWeb`)**:
  - Upgraded Web file saving to utilize the modern File System Access API (`window.showSaveFilePicker`), prompting users with the native OS file picker to select a destination directory and customize or confirm the file name.
  - Automatically populated the save dialog with the document's intelligent default display name (`ScoreTitle.sarv` or `Untitled Manuscript.sarv`).
  - Fixed premature `URL.revokeObjectURL` invocation in `downloadFileWeb`, eliminating browser download truncation to 0 bytes and loss of default filenames during browser downloads.
- **Web Build `.sarv` Document Loading & Parity (`openFileWeb`)**:
  - Resolved issue where loading `.sarv` documents in Web failed with corrupt file errors by bypassing `file_picker`'s web `JSArrayBuffer` casting limitation in favor of direct `window.showOpenFilePicker` and `FileReader.readAsText`.
  - Added automatic UTF-8 BOM (`\uFEFF`) stripping and dynamic Map deserialization resilience to guarantee full cross-platform compatibility with documents created on Linux or Windows.
  - Added `WorkspaceCubit.openDocumentTab` to mount parsed documents into tabs directly without attempting unsupported direct filesystem reads on Web.
- **Recent Documents Menu Activation & Deactivated Ancestor Error (`TopBarFileMenu`)**:
  - Fixed a crash (`Looking up a deactivated widget's ancestor is unsafe`) when opening a document from the Open Recent submenu caused by `BuildContext` shadowing inside `RecentDocumentsService`'s `ValueListenableBuilder`.
- **Android File Picker Extension Filter & Storage Resilience (`SarvFileService`)**:
  - Resolved `PlatformException(FilePicker, Unsupported filter...)` on Android caused by Android OS `MimeTypeMap` failing to resolve unregistered custom `.sarv` file extensions.
  - Configured `FileType.any` on Android and mobile platforms, paired with graceful `PlatformException` recovery and strict JSON/schema content validation.
  - Hardened `saveAsSarvFile` against Storage Access Framework (SAF) direct file write exceptions.
  - Re-routed `handleOpenRecentDocument` to bind to the persistent top bar widget's `BuildContext` instead of the transient menu popup overlay element tree that is deactivated upon item tap.
  - Hardened cubit resolution in `top_bar_menu_handler.dart` by resolving `WorkspaceCubit` and `DocumentCubit` synchronously before asynchronous suspension points, and guarded UI dialog and snackbar feedback with `context.mounted`.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-27

### Changed
- **Intent-Based Nomenclature & Touch/Pointer Architecture**:
  - Renamed `mobile/` directory to `touch/` and established intent-first component naming (`TouchCanvasArea`, `TouchTopBar`, `FloatingHud`, `SettingsPanel`).
  - Renamed screens to `PointerEditorScreen` and `TouchEditorScreen`, and top bar to `PointerTopBar`.
  - Replaced ambiguous breakpoint names in `SarvBreakpoints` with explicit layout event names (`bothSidebarsDockedMinWidth`, `primarySidebarDockedMinWidth`, `fullMenuBarMinWidth`).
- **Standardized Responsive Display Contract (`SarvDisplayContext`)**:
  - Introduced `SarvDisplayData`, `SarvDisplayContext`, `SarvDisplayScope`, and `SarvFormFactor` (`phone`, `tablet`, `desktop`) to decouple input modality from viewport classification.
  - Migrated modal dialogs (`showSarvAdaptiveModal`, `AboutSarvDialog`, `ExportDialog`, `StaffConfigDialog`, and configuration tabs) away from raw `MediaQuery` checks.
- **Unified Canvas Geometry Engine (`CanvasZoomCalculator`)**:
  - Centralized zoom preset calculations, safe-area offsets, and transformation matrices into `CanvasZoomCalculator`, eliminating duplicate zoom math across editor shells.
- **Reboot-Free Input Mode Switching (`AppShell`)**:
  - Introduced `AppShell` as the root adaptive shell listening to `ViewCubit.state.inputMode` via `AnimatedSwitcher`.
  - Upgraded `InputModeToggleButton` to switch modes instantaneously without destroying the navigator history stack or replaying the splash screen.

### Added
- **Mobile Keyboard Inset Resilience & Comfortable Input Clearance**:
  - Wrapped `SettingsPanel` drawer content in `AnimatedPadding` reacting to `MediaQuery.viewInsetsOf(context).bottom`, shrinking the inner `ListView` scroll viewport and ensuring focused inputs remain visible when the soft keyboard appears.
  - Adapted modal bottom sheets and dialogs in `showSarvAdaptiveModal` to constrain `maxHeight` by available height (`screenHeight - viewInsets.bottom`) and lift the sheet cleanly above the keyboard.
  - Standardized `AppSpacing.keyboardScrollPadding` (64px bottom clearance) across numeric scrubbers, margins, staff spacing, precision sliders, export dialogs, and hierarchy labeling fields, guaranteeing generous headroom above on-screen software keyboards.
  - Added comprehensive widget test suite (`mobile_keyboard_inset_test.dart`) covering drawer shrinking, text field visibility, and modal bottom sheet positioning under soft keyboard view insets.
- **Cross-Mode Panel State Synchronization & "The Section Spine" Navigation Rail**:
  - Implemented bidirectional active section handoff between Pointer Mode (desktop sidebar with `SectionSpine`) and Touch Mode (drawer subpages), maintaining focused section context across mode toggles and window resizes.
  - Built "The Section Spine" (`SectionSpine`): a slender, constant 22px scroll rail featuring piecewise-linear handle mapping, dynamic top-section viewport detection, and click-to-jump-and-expand navigation.
  - Modularized spine rail architecture into focused components: `SectionSpineTrack` (groove, progress fill, boundary stops), `SectionSpineHandle` (fader thumb with tactile 3-line ribbed grip and grab cursor), and `SectionSpineBead` (jewel buttons with frosted-glass floating badges and fold chips).
  - Unboxed sidebar sections (`CollapsibleSectionCard`): removed heavy card containers and borders for a spacious full-width layout with dynamic, non-clipping stationary states.
  - Reclaimed 16px of horizontal space on Pointer sidebar by reducing right padding to 8px, and reserved 4px safety margins around profile cards to prevent hover clipping.
- **Progressive Multi-Tier Desktop Top Bar & Cascading App Menu**:
  - Implemented progressive multi-tier compaction for desktop viewports (`SarvBreakpoints.desktopTopBarMenuThreshold = 760.0`).
  - Added a dedicated application menu button `[ ☰ ]` (`TopBarCompactAppMenu`) for viewports narrower than 760px that opens a clean cascading `MenuAnchor` with 4 submenus (*File ❯*, *Edit ❯*, *View ❯*, *Help ❯*).
  - Standardized all desktop menus (`TopBarFileMenu`, `TopBarEditMenu`, `TopBarViewMenu`, `TopBarHelpMenu`) to use unified `MenuAnchor`, `MenuItemButton`, and `SubmenuButton` structures, exposing reusable static `buildChildren` builders.
  - Reorganized page size presets in the View menu under a cascading `Score Page Sizes ▸` submenu with active selection indicators.
- **Adaptive Dynamic Header ("Zen Top Bar") in Touch Mode**:
  - Implemented smart viewport-aware top bar pinning: defaults to pinned in portrait (`height >= 500dp`) and unpinned in landscape/compact screens (`height < 500dp`), reclaiming 15–20% of vertical canvas space.
  - Added an interactive pin/unpin toggle button (`Icons.push_pin` / `Icons.push_pin_outlined`) in the top bar with persistent user overrides.
  - Added full canvas gesture immersion: when unpinned, the top bar smoothly slides up off-screen (`Offset(0, -1.3)`) in sync with the bottom Conductor HUD on pan/zoom, restoring borderless score visibility.
  - Standardized the collapsed floating top bar to a 40dp capsule height (matching the expanded toolbar and coordinate HUD) with a reactive intrinsic width dynamically sized to document title length with clamped bounds (`120dp` to `340dp`).
  - Added dynamic ruler clearance: positioned unpinned top bar (both collapsed capsule and expanded toolbar) 6dp below the top ruler and 8dp past the left ruler, preventing any ruler occlusion or origin-switcher blocking.
  - Implemented conflict-free coordinate HUD visibility: long-pressing and dragging on the canvas to inspect coordinates automatically collapses and dismisses the floating top bar off-screen, giving unobstructed visibility to the top glassmorphic coordinate HUD.
  - Enhanced inline title editing: temporarily hides flanking top bar controls in tight/portrait screens to maximize text field room, complete with a dedicated Done button, click-outside auto-save, and system back navigation handling.
- **Safe-Area Aware Rulers & Edge-to-Edge Bleed**:
  - Top and left manuscript canvas rulers now dynamically adapt to device notches, status bars, and display cutouts.
  - The canvas background bleeds edge-to-edge under the status bar, while `RulerBox` expands its top and left background strips and positions graduation numbers, ticks, and the `mm` origin switcher safely below cutouts.
- **Dual-Island Mobile Conductor Toolbar & Gestural Drawer Trigger**:
  - Decoupled the mobile bottom HUD into independent Left (menu, undo, redo) and Right (zoom, telemetry, guides) wings with 11dp ruler clearance and independent idle auto-collapse timers.
  - Implemented continuous bi-directional drag zoom on both collapsed and expanded zoom chips (drag up/right to zoom in, down/left to zoom out) with tactile haptic selection clicks.
  - Added smooth idle visual transitions on the collapsed zoom chip: active interaction renders prominent percentage text with a subtle background watermark; after 2.5s of inactivity, the percentage softens and the magnifier watermark smoothly fades in.
  - Added a horizontal right-drag gesture on the Menu HUD in both collapsed and expanded states to intuitively open the navigation drawer (or landscape side sheet) with tactile haptic feedback.
- **Adaptive Desktop Responsive Layout**:
  - Automatically transitions sidebars between docked mode on wide monitors, floating canvas overlays on medium screens, and auto-collapsing slide-out drawers on split or compact windows, ensuring the manuscript canvas remains fully visible.
  - Added high-visibility edge resize handles with smooth dragging and persistent panel widths.
- **Pointer vs. Touch Interaction Toggle**:
  - Added an input mode toggle in the top bar to freely switch between precision desktop pointer controls and touch-first mobile navigation on any screen size.
- **Automated Android CI Pipeline**:
  - Added automated build workflows to package and attach signed release APKs on Git version tags.

### Changed
- **Decoupled Brand Logo From Dropdown Trigger**:
  - `SarvReactiveBrandLogo` now consistently operates as a pure interactive brand mark (`isMenuMode: false`) across wide and compact desktop modes, preserving hover expansion to *"Manuscript Designer"* and tap-to-About interactions.
  - Replaced the legacy 416-line flat popup menu (`compact_menu.dart`) with native cascading submenus sharing the exact desktop menu tree.
- **Mobile Landscape Side Navigation**:
  - Transformed the landscape menu into an on-demand, thumb-friendly side drawer with backdrop dismissal, keeping over 60% of the manuscript score in view.
  - Redesigned menu categories into a compact, single-screen layout with an integrated score summary below.
  - Automatically recalculates score fitting when rotating between portrait and landscape orientations.

### Removed
- **Obsolete Top-Bar Ensemble Profile Picker**:
  - Permanently removed `EnsembleProfilePicker` from the top bar and codebase, reclaiming ~130px of horizontal top bar real estate and eliminating redundant profile switching controls since profile configuration is fully handled in the sidebar.

### Fixed
- **Canvas Hold-and-Drag Coordinate HUD in Touch Mode**:
  - Suppressed duplicate bottom coordinate readout during canvas hold-and-drag inspection in `TouchEditorScreen`, maintaining focus on the top coordinate HUD.
- **Top Bar Title Editing Space & Padding**:
  - Re-enabled flexible title field expansion (`expandInEditMode`) in `EditableScoreHeader` across both `PointerTopBar` and `TouchTopBar`, eliminating artificial 240/300px width bottlenecks and large empty gaps during inline title editing.
- **Dialog Ergonomics on Compact & Landscape Screens**:
  - Resolved cramped layout and overflow issues in staff configuration, calibration, and export dialogs on short viewports and dynamically resized windows.
  - Added adaptive preview scaling and compact tab bars to the staff configuration modal.
- **Grouped Staff Removal Integrity**:
  - Fixed an issue where removing an individual instrument within an ensemble group could unintentionally delete the entire parent section.

  - **Sealed `Clef` Hierarchy**: Polymorphic sealed `Clef` class hierarchy (`TrebleClef`, `BassClef`, `AltoClef`, `TenorClef`, `PercussionClef`, `TabClef`) replacing procedural string/enum switches with reference pitch (`referencePitch`), anchor line (`anchorLine`), and octave shift (`octaveShift`) properties.
  - **Sealed `StaffNode` Tree Hierarchy**: Structural system layout representation using composable `StaffNodeGroup` and `StaffDefinition` tree nodes supporting system connectors (`brace`, `bracket`, `line`, `none`) and continuous barlines.
  - **Unified `SarvDocument` Value Model**: Combined immutable domain snapshot encapsulating `Score` notation AST and `PageConfig` physical layout into a single source of truth.
  - **Engraving Token Abstraction (`EngravingConfig`)**: Centralized layout spacing, Gouldian engraving rules, SMuFL glyph scales, and barline overhang tokens embedded in `PageConfig`.
  - **Layout Policy Abstraction (`LayoutPolicyMode`)**: Core policy modes (`bilingualFluid`, `canvasStrict`, `documentRtl`) abstracting physical CAD boundaries, canvas orientation, and BiDi parameter enforcement.
  - **Direct PDF Vector Emitter Abstraction (`pdf_emitter.dart`)**: Pure Dart zero-dependency vector PDF compilation engine operating in memory.
- **Unified Document State & Transactional Undo/Redo Engine**: Introduced `SarvDocument` domain model (combining `Score` AST and `PageConfig` physical layout) and `DocumentCubit` to manage unified document state and transactional undo/redo across both score notation and page layout mutations (`Ctrl+Z`, `Ctrl+Y`, top bar cluster, and Edit menu).
- **Command Coalescing Engine**: Automatic time-window command merging (`coalesceThreshold: 600ms`) in `CommandHistory` and drag-end commit callbacks (`onChangeStart`, `onChangeEnd`) in `PrecisionSlider`, ensuring continuous slider/stepper adjustments do not pollute the undo stack.
- **Instrument Preset Registry**: Introduced `InstrumentRegistry` featuring 5 instrument families, presets with exact line counts and default clefs, and `LayoutPolicyMode` support.
- **`ScoreCompiler` Service**: Centralized service in `sarvmd_core` for LaTeX/PDF/SVG compilation, effective title resolution (`getEffectiveTitle`), default file name generation, and query sanitization.
- **Top Bar Staff Management Sub-Menus**: Added standard **Add Staff to System** sub-menu (Treble, Bass, Grand Staff, Guitar TAB, Rhythm, Custom), **Edit Staff** sub-menu (launches `StaffConfigDialog` for any active staff), and **Remove Staff** sub-menu with safety checks in `TopBarEditMenu`.
- **Global Keyboard Shortcut Gateway**: Integrated `SarvShortcutGateway` wrapping the application layout to catch global `Ctrl+Z` (Undo) and `Ctrl+Y` (Redo) keyboard shortcuts seamlessly.

### Changed
- **Modular Top Bar Architecture**: Refactored `SarvTopBar` into decoupled modular components (`top_bar_menu_header.dart`, `top_bar_menu_handler.dart`, `editable_score_header.dart`, `ensemble_profile_picker.dart`, `undo_redo_cluster.dart`, `file_menu.dart`, `edit_menu.dart`, `view_menu.dart`, `help_menu.dart`, `compact_menu.dart`).
- **Compact Viewport Menu Parity**: Ported all desktop menu bar features (Add/Edit/Remove Staff, View settings, Export, About, Language switch) to the compact logo dropdown menu (<960px).
- **Single Source of Truth Title Synchronization**: Synchronized score title with file export names via `EditableScoreHeader` center-zone inline editing and `ScoreCompiler.getEffectiveTitle`.
- **Score AST Streamlining**: Removed obsolete `composer` field from `Score` AST and commands to focus `Score` strictly on title metadata and part definitions.
- **State Management Consolidation**: Deleted obsolete separate `ScoreCubit` and `ConfigCubit` implementations, unifying all state under `DocumentCubit`.
- **Custom Staff Preset Defaults**: Custom staves now initialize with clean, empty labels instead of defaulting to `"Custom Staff"`.

### Fixed
- **Staff Deletion Safety Guards**: Implemented minimum staff count guards in `RemoveStaffByUidCommand` and `StaffConfigDialog` to prevent accidental deletion of the last remaining staff in a manuscript layout.
- **Continuous Input Undo History**: Resolved undo history bloat during live slider drag operations by executing coalesced transactional commands on drag completion.
